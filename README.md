# Unsceneted Kalman Filter for bicycle detection on the road
The objective of this project is to detect a bicyle travelling around a car. The car is fitted with Lidar and radar sensors. Noisy lidar and radar data measurements are avilable. An unsceneted Kalman Filter has been implemented for this purpose.
